This is a minecraft server for personal use. Used it as a little fun
devops project. 
1. Created a Docker container.
2. Pushed it, alongsite its image, to Google Cloud Console
3. Created a VM instance with that Docker container (stored on gcr.io)
4. Tweaked firewall to allow connections on port 25565 and assigned a static ip
5. Finally, it works!
